# Polygon

The computation of polygon area is a fundamental part of Computational Science.

Most interesting polygons are for example:

* Triangle
* Quadrilateral

## Requirements

Write a software able to compute the area of the polygons listed:

* Simple Polygon
  * Triangle
    * Triangle Equilateral
  * Quadrilateral
    * Rectangle
    * Square

The following structure shall be implemented:

- Each type of polygon must implement a new method for computing the area by varying the information available for computing it;

- Depending on the information available, the polygon must call such new method or a method of a class higher in hierarchy.
